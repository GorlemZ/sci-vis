In this project, we want explore the topic of cotton, starting from the plant itself and following it all the way to the ways people use it in everyday life. Our idea is to use data visualization not just to show numbers, but to tell a story: how cotton grows, where it can be found in the world, how it is traded and transformed, and how it finally becomes part of our culture through crafting and textiles.

We begin with the botany and distribution of cotton species and later we expand the project by looking at cotton production and trade, and finally at the social and cultural side of craftingâ€”from spinning fibers to knitting or weaving. This way, the project grows from the plant to the sweater, showing how something that begins as a seed connects ecosystems, economies, and communities.
